                Social media addiction is a big problem in todays world. Jobless humans and cats alike are susceptible to social media addiction. Side effects may include typing it-seemed-funny-in-the-head-but-its-actually-not paragraphs on internet, day dreaming talking to imaginary people and reflecting on your life choices in the late night, alone.  <br> <br> <br>
                This is a very real and a very relatable issue in the modern world. If you have made this far reading this poetic genius of sleepy thoughts, you may very well be losing your sanity. Please seek help. This is a serious issue.

            <div class="pointPara">
                A common misinformation about social media is that everything posted on it is true. However, social media can be a breeding ground for fake news and misinformation. Anyone can post without fact-checking, and algorithms prioritize sensational content. <br> <br> <br>
                Some people intentionally spread false information to serve their own interests. It's crucial to fact-check and be critical of what you see on social media.
